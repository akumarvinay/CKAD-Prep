Create the pod:

kubectl apply -f /usr/ckad/adapter-pod.yml
Verify that the pod starts up:

kubectl get pod counter
You can also verify that everything is working by checking the output directory on the worker node. Log in to the worker from the master:

ssh cloud_user@<IP ADDRESS>
Look for the fluentd output files in the output directory:

ls /usr/ckad/log_output
